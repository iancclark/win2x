# win2x
Send keyboard/mouse events from a windows system to an X display using Xtst

This is from a utility I wrote in the early 2000s to let me control my linux desktop from my windows PC. I have vague memories that it worked, but having reviewed the code I'm not so sure.

It was written with in the LCC/Wedit IDE, and will probably be difficult to get to compile again.
